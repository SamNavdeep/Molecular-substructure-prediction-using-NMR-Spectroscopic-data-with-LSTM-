The objective of this project is to predict molecular substructures from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data using a deep learning approach. Specifically, the task is formulated as a supervised learning problem where sequential NMR features are mapped to the presence or absence of specific molecular substructures. An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network is used due to its ability to model sequential and contextual dependencies in spectral data.
